While looking for work in LA (where I was living at the time), I started doing some remote QC of regulatory documents for bluebird bio where a programming position in clinical data management later opened up.

Although the renewable energy industry challenging and erratic, I enjoy using my problem-solving skills and creativity to add value to our organization and our clients. I am also passionate about improving current systems and aligning strategic and financial plans along with organizational goals.

My key strengths and skills include:
• Project management
• Insightful financial analysis
• Risk management
• Strategic team guidance
• Strong adaptability

Creating something of value – be it within your career, your business or your life – will lead to success. That is something I learned while growing up in Brazil and deciding what kind of career path I would like to pursue. I still strongly believe in this concept and have chosen to embrace it by starting my career in the renewable energy field.

I am interested in developing algorithms for a variety of multi-agent systems, from robots to satellite constellations. I aim to take an interdisciplinary approach to collective robotics, integrating bio-inspiration and mathematical modeling to develop algorithms that can be applied beyond the lab.

I am seeking a research-oriented position in robotics for spring 2022, after the completion of my PhD.

My current research focuses on creating algorithms for distributed decision-making in robot swarms. Specifically, I am developing a modular framework for allowing robots to collectively solve a variety of environmental classification and localization problems. I am also developing collective of low-cost robots capable of moving as aggregate group, inspired by insect larvae.

I consider myself a full-stack roboticist, working on both software (algorithms and control) and hardware (mechanical and electronic design). This lets me consider mechanical and algorithmic co-design in developing robust robot behavior.

99,Environmental Engineer at Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP),"Boston, Massachusetts, United States",Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP),Northeastern university,"My background includes experience as an Environmental Engineer for a highway and bridge Construction Company and an associate project researcher for a research academy of environmental sciences. Most of my work was undertaken outdoor on site. I monitored the environmental situation for the Airport Gateway Project through site inspection and write weekly and monthly reports and submitting them to the BEST Commission. I am familiar with monitoring of effluent, data checking and validation and writing reports.

Prior to enrolling in the MS program at Northeastern University, I worked as a Project Researcher to work with the State Environmental Protection Agency to inspect the water-quality control of the capital city’s main river. During the time with the Agency, I accumulated a great deal of practical experience such as building wastewater treatment facilities and reducing heavy metals pollution. Not only did I perform routine measurements like pH, BOD, COD, concentration of heavy metals As and Hg, but I also assisted in the development of some unusual assays to test the phytoplankton levels in the river during the summer season.

In addition, I joined a research team during my junior and senior years to investigate the heavy metal hyper accumulation plants and their behavior under different concentration of heavy metals Zn, Cd and Pb. This was accomplished by using technologies including Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM).

Both my work and laboratory experiences have expanded my practical skills and enhanced my professional view of Environmental Engineering, appropriately preparing me in environmental field.
